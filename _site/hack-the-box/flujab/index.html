<meta name="description" content="Quick Summary Hey guys today FluJab retired and here’s my write-up about it. This machine had a lot of rabbit holes and trolls which made it hard to enjoy the machine. But without mentioning those annoying things this machine had some really cool web exploitation parts like cookie manipulation, authentication bypasses and most importantly an interesting SQL injection vulnerability. Ajenti administration panel was installed on the box and I could get credentials for it by exploiting the SQLi, After that I could use a user’s public ssh key to get the private key as it was vulnerable to CVE-2008-0166 then I escaped rbash and exploited a vulnerable version of screen to get a root shell. It’s a Linux box and its ip is 10.10.10.124, I added it to /etc/hosts as flujab.htb. Let’s jump right in ! Nmap As always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services : nmap -sV -sT -sC flujab.htb We got ssh on port 22, http on ports 80 and 8080 and https on port 443. There’s also some sort of virtual hosting as we can see from the nmap scan and there are a lot of domains … We can also check the ssl certificate manually : HTTP I added all of them to /etc/hosts and checked them, However I will skip the rabbit holes in the write-up because it’s just a waste of time. If we take a look at what we have : The machine name is flujab so we are only interested in : console.flujab.htb sys.flujab.htb smtp.flujab.htb freeflujab.htb flujab.htb We saw that error about direct ip access when we visited flujab.htb, Let’s check the other 4. console.flujab.htb : Just a troll ! sys.flujab.htb : The same error on flujab.htb smtp.flujab.htb : We don’t have any credentials for that. freeflujab.htb : That one is interesting. I tried to run gobuster but there was a wildcard response. When I checked manually I found that instead of responding with 404 it responds with a redirection to https://clownware.htb/cwerror_pages.php which has a gif of a strange creepy clown … Note : I checked them all on port 8080 too but I always got the direct ip access error. I started burp and configured the scope : Then I ran the spider : Results : I checked the requests and the responses of different pages and actions. I noticed in one of the responses a Set-Cookie header that sets a cookie called Modus and sets the path for it to /?smtp_config. I requested /?smtp_config in the browser and looked at the request in burp : Request : Response : The response was a redirection to /?denied. We are sending 3 cookies in every request : Modus , Patient and Registered. Modus and Registered are base-64 encoded strings while Patient is an md5 hash. Modus = Configure=Null Registered = f991b5fb6a2939471c7230b2db78225e=Null Registered is using the same hash from Patient, After some guesses I found that this hash is for my ip : Anyway we can try to change these values from Null to True and see what happens : Request : GET /?smtp_config HTTP/1.1 Host: freeflujab.htb User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Cookie: Modus=Q29uZmlndXJlPVRydWU%3d; Patient=f991b5fb6a2939471c7230b2db78225e; Registered=Zjk5MWI1ZmI2YTI5Mzk0NzFjNzIzMGIyZGI3ODIyNWU9VHJ1ZQo%3d Connection: close Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Response : HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Thu, 15 Jun 2019 10:34:17 GMT Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 Connection: close Server: ClownWare Proxy Content-Length: 3735 Great, we can access the page now.

This machine had a lot of rabbit holes and trolls which made it hard to enjoy the machine. But without mentioning those annoying things this machine had some really cool web exploitation parts like cookie manipulation, authentication bypasses and most importantly an interesting <code class="highlighter-rouge">SQL</code> injection vulnerability. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ajenti</code> administration panel was installed on the box and I could get credentials for it by exploiting the <code class="highlighter-rouge">SQLi</code>,  After that I could use a user’s public ssh key to get the private key as it was vulnerable to <code class="highlighter-rouge">CVE-2008-0166</code> then I escaped <code class="highlighter-rouge">rbash</code> and exploited a vulnerable version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">screen</code> to get a root shell. It’s a Linux box and its ip is <code class="highlighter-rouge">10.10.10.124</code>, I added it to <code class="highlighter-rouge">/etc/hosts</code> as <code class="highlighter-rouge">flujab.htb</code>.
