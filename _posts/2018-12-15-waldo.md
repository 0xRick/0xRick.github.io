### Quick Summary
#### Waldo was a great box and what makes it special is its unique way in getting the root flag. Every step with this box was very fun and I liked this box too much. 
#### It's a linux box and its ip is 10.10.10.87 so let's jump right in

### Nmap
#### Starting with nmap to scan for open TCP ports and services.
`nmap -sV -sT 10.10.10.87 `
![](/images/hackthebox/waldo/1.png)
#### We only see http on port 80 and ssh on port 22.
#### On port 80 there's a web application called List Manager.

### Path Traversal
#### We will intercept the traffic with Burp then we will start to perform actions on the application like creating a list , editing it , deleteing it etc..

#### By looking at the requests we will find two interesting requests.
#### The POST request to fileRead.php and the POST request to dirRead.php.
<br>
#### Let's send them to the repeater and play with them.
#### We will notice that dirRead.php lists the contents of a directory by giving the path in a POST request so we might have a path traversal vulnerability here.
<br> 
#### If we tried to go up one directory it works

#### But going up 2 directories doesn't work so there might be a filter that prevents that.
#### We can try to bypass the filter by adding another `../`. And it worked

### SSH key for monitor
#### Then after enumerating in home directory we will find out that we can read the ssh key of a user called nobody `/home/nobody/.ssh` but the ssh key  is called .monitor

<br>
#### But we can only read directories with dirRead.php. 
#### If we check fileRead.php we will find a path traversal there too.

<br>
#### Now we have the key but it's json decoded. We can use any online json decoder.

### SSH as nobody 
#### Now will change permissions to 600 then try ssh with nobody. If we try monitor it will give us permission denied.
`chmod 600 monitor.key`
<br>
`ssh -i monitor.key nobody@10.10.10.87`

#### And we got user !
<br>
<hr>
## Privilege Escalation to monitor

#### After we login as nobody we need to elevate to a higher privileged user.
#### Since we couldn't ssh as monitor before let's try again but this time locally.

![](/images/hackthebox/waldo/17.png)
#### And We're in as monitor .
#### But we are in a restricted shell and can't run commands .
![](/images/hackthebox/waldo/18.png)
<br>
#### We can try some commands and ls will work . 
![](/images/hackthebox/waldo/19.png)
<br>
#### We see two directories app-dev and bin .
#### Let's ls bin and see what commands can we run .
![](/images/hackthebox/waldo/20.png)
#### We can run ls , most , red , rnano
#### rnano and red are restricted versions of the text editors nano and ed
<br>
<hr>
## Escaping the restricted shell
#### We can use red to escape.
#### We will run it first .
`red`
#### Then we will execute sh from the editor .
`!'/bin/sh'`
#### And we cd to /bin and execute bash .
#### And we escaped the shell !

## Exploiting Capabilities and getting root.txt
<br>
#### This is where the awesome part comes. For me it was the first time to deal with linux capabilities.
#### If we look at the bins in /sbin we will see getcap.
![](/images/hackthebox/waldo/23.png)
#### So If we run getcap on the bin folders. 
![](/images/hackthebox/waldo/24.png)
![](/images/hackthebox/waldo/25.png)
#### We will find under `/usr/bin` that a binary named tac has the `cap_dac read_search+ei` capability 
#### This allows it to read files as root .
#### And tac does exactly the same as cat but the name is reversed . 
#### We can simply read root.txt 
`tac /root/root.txt `
